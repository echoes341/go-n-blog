# go-n-blog
Experimental personal project of a REST blog entirely written in Go as backend

This is a bunch of experiments I did while I was studying Go and Angular 4. As GitHub is complaining Angular side is dangerous 
(old dependecies, blah blah blah) I decided to remove the whole thing. 

If you're _so_ interested to know how it was, just feel free to navigate commit history of course.
